# Weekly Report0919

**This week, I focused on advancing my TDF Project 1, which involves designing a parametric Apple Watch stand as an accessory for an IKEA pegboard. The goal was to create a functional stand that could not only hold and charge the watch but also serve as a visual reminder for me to use it.**

I began the process by researching existing designs online for inspiration. After identifying key requirements—such as incorporating space for the charger and ensuring the watch faced me for easy viewing—I sketched an initial concept. Using Grasshopper, I created a parametric model, starting with a basic rectangular shape and developing it into a curved surface that could be securely attached to the pegboard.

The first version of the 3D-printed stand had incorrect dimensions for the charger opening, making it impossible to fit the charging puck. I made adjustments and printed a second version, but it still didn’t fit as intended. I realized the error was in the measurement and alignment of the charger space.

Despite these setbacks, I remained persistent. I re-measured the charger dimensions and adjusted the model in Grasshopper. After rechecking all the parameters and making the necessary modifications, I printed a third version. This time, the charger fit perfectly, and the stand functioned as intended.

Reflection：This week’s experience highlighted the importance of iterative design and testing, especially in parametric modeling. Each mistake was an opportunity to refine my approach and improve the accuracy of my model. While it was frustrating to see the first two prototypes fail, it was a valuable learning process that underscored the need for precision and thoroughness in every step, from initial measurements to final printing.

Speculation：Moving forward, I plan to explore additional features for the stand, such as incorporating a small tray for other items or adjusting the angle to improve visibility further. I’m also considering using different materials or finishes for future iterations to enhance the overall aesthetics and functionality.

Overall, this week was a challenging but rewarding part of the project. I’ve gained a deeper understanding of parametric modeling and 3D printing, and I’m excited to continue refining my design and exploring new possibilities
