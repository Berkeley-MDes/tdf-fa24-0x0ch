**Weekly Report006**

This week I attempted soldering the Photon and tested the code using Stemma.

During this process, I'm very grateful for the help from my classmates Yingying and Dianer.

We also formed a group, prepared a proposal and workflow.

Starting from daily life, we plan to design some wearable hardware for women's safety. Looking forward to the upcoming collaboration
